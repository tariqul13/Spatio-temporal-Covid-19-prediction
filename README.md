# Spatio-temporal-Covid-19-prediction
This study addresses the challenges of disease forecasting by evaluating and enhancing three multivariate neural network models: GCN_LSTM, GAT_LSTM, and GTN_LSTM. It demonstrates that the GCN_LSTM model outperforms the others in predicting disease progression and uses this model to assess the impact of state-level public health policies on disease dynamics.
