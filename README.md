This study addresses the challenges of disease forecasting by evaluating and enhancing three multivariate neural network models: GCN_LSTM, GAT_LSTM, and GTN_LSTM, demonstrating that the GCN_LSTM model outperforms others in predicting disease progression, and using it to assess the impact of state-level public health policies on disease dynamics.
